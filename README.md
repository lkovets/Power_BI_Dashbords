# Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power BI — Course Project


Hi there! 👋 I am currently learning Data Analytics, and this is a practice project I created to sharpen my Power BI skills.

The goal of this dashboard is to solve a common problem for job seekers: information about the data job market is often scattered. Using a real-world dataset of job postings spanning **2023 to 2025**, I built this interactive tool to practice visualizing salaries, job popularity, and market trends over several years.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Overview

### 1. Main Page: High-Level Market View
This is the main overview where I practiced creating key KPIs. It shows total job counts, median salaries, and overall market dynamics across the dataset's timeframe.

### 2. Deep Dive: Job Title Drill Through
One of the key features I wanted to learn was the **Drill Through** functionality. I set it up so users can select a specific profession on the main page and navigate to a detailed view for that specific role.

## 🚀 Skills I'm Practicing (Tech Stack)

This project helps me apply the concepts I'm currently studying in Power BI:

### ⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL)
* **Power Query:** I practiced cleaning raw data, handling blank values (nulls), changing data types, and creating custom columns to get the multi-year dataset ready for analysis.

### 🧮 Measures & Calculations
* I worked on creating implicit measures to calculate insights like `Median Yearly Salary` and `Job Count`.
* I'm learning how to aggregate data effectively to build meaningful charts.

### 📊 Data Visualization
I experimented with different chart types to visualize the data:
* **Bar & Column Charts:** To compare job counts.
* **Line Charts:** To analyze hiring trends over the **2023-2025** period.
* **Map Charts:** To practice geospatial analysis.
* **Cards:** To display big numbers (KPIs).

### 🖱️ UX/UI & Interactivity
To make the report interactive, I applied:
* **Slicers:** For filtering data by year or job title.
* **Buttons & Bookmarks:** For navigation between views.
* **Drill-Through:** To connect summary data with detailed insights.

## 💡 Conclusion

This dashboard represents a significant **milestone** in my ongoing Data Analytics journey. It bridges the gap between theory and practice, demonstrating how I am applying the skills I am currently mastering.

By transforming job market data (2023–2025) into an interactive experience, I have established a strong foundation in end-to-end BI development. This project serves as a dynamic portfolio piece that I plan to refine and expand as I continue to learn advanced techniques.

Thank you for following my progress! ⭐
